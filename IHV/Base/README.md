**Impala:** Click [here](https://github.infra.cloudera.com/pkatti/CDP_IHV_Validation/tree/main/impala-tpcds-kit) to proceed with Impala TPC-DS test. 

You will need to perform these tests on the gateway/edge node. If you donâ€™t have an edge node in your cluster, please feel free to run this on any datanode. 

Please note that the choice of scale is up to you. We generally recommend running the tests for 1T data volume. If your requirement is to run it for higher volume, please feel free to do so. However, those might need some tweaking in the resource configuration.
